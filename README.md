## ABSTRACT
Final Project Thesis
COMPARING THE EFFICACY OF DEEP LEARNING AND TRADITIONAL ALGORITHMS IN TUMOR SEGMENTATION WITHIN 3D LUNG CT IMAGES

Mutations, which are alterations in cellular genetic material, can give rise to benign or malignant tumors due to unregulated cellular activity. When malignant tumors develop, they are referred to as cancer. Lung cancer is particularly lethal, claiming the highest mortality rate among cancers at 18%. This high rate is mainly due to the difficulty in early detection of the disease, which is crucial for effective treatment. Computed Tomography (CT) imaging has emerged as a promising technique for the early detection of lung cancer. It boasts high resolution, the ability to distinctly visualize different tissue types, rapid image capture, and the ability to detect small nodules. Moreover, CT imaging offers a 3D view, which is invaluable in diagnosis. Often used alongside Positron Emission Tomography (PET), CT is considered highly effective for lung cancer diagnosis. Essentially, CT is a medical imaging system that utilizes X-rays to obtain 3D images. In analyzing lung CT images, computer-aided diagnostic systems are employed, particularly when precision is necessary, as in differentiating tumor regions from surrounding tissues or when large volumes of images need to be interpreted. These systems utilize image segmentation to isolate regions of interest, aiding in accurate diagnosis and automating tissue detection processes. In the realm of medical imaging, precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring disease progression, as it allows clinicians to detect tissue abnormalities or changes that may signify disease. This information is crucial in formulating treatment strategies and tracking their efficacy. Segmentation algorithms can be categorized as deep learning-based or traditional. While the former employs neural networks to learn how to identify and segment structures within an image, the latter typically depends on mathematical models or algorithms for segmentation. This project aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy of deep learning-based segmentation algorithms with traditional ones in segmenting lung tumors in CT images. For the traditional segmentation algorithms, the Otsu threshold method, region-growing method, and Chan-Vese active contours method were utilized. For the deep learning approach, the 2D U-Net architecture was implemented. Through various evaluation metrics, it was observed that the 2D U-Net architecture, with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores ranging from 0.5691 to 0.8850, outperformed the traditional segmentation algorithms under different conditions.
